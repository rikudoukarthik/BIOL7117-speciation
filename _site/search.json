    "text": "3.1 Coathup et al 2024\n\nTheory says sympatric speciation facilitated by magic traits which might be encoded by pleiotropic genes, but little evidence exists of sympatric speciation and empirical evidence of magic traits is rare. Authors investigated role of pleitropy in Howea speciation. They found multiple genes showing adaptive divergence between the sister species (sign of pleiotropy, in soil stress tolerance and flowering time).\nAlternative to magic traits/pleiotropy driving sympatric ecological speciation is linkage disequilibrium. (i.e., one allele with multiple effects vs two close alleles not separated in recombination.) In either case, “major effect loci”.\nDunning et al 2016 and Osborne et al 2019 assessed gene expression and genetic divergence. They identified candidate pleiotropic speciation genes. The current study aimed to test whether these genes actually are pleiotropic loci affecting soil stress tolerance and flowering time. If so, this would be positive evidence for magic traits.\nMethod: T-DNA knockout A. thaliana used for high-throughput phenotyping (knockouts in orthologues of candidate speciation genes, 11 knockout mutants).\n\nGrown under various stress emulating Lord Howe Island. Then morphology, stress responses and flowering time measured.\n\nFive genes potential speciation genes: knockouts in each of these showed displaced flowering times and altered soil stress response (cadmium, drought, salt). Largest effect sizes in SAL1 (latest flowering) and SIZ1 (earliest flowering)\n\nKnockout of SIZ1 caused reduced drought tolerance. H. belmoreana has lower expression of the two SIZ1 homologues and also cannot colonise calcareous soils. On the other hand, knockout of SAL1 caused increased drought tolerance (consistent with H. forsteriana), but reduced salt tolerance which doesn’t match with Howea scenario—so less evidence for this locus driving sympatric speciation cf SIZ1.\n\nRobust example of genetic architecture of sympatric speciation. Evidence of pleiotropy in multiple loci, so could be a combination of pleiotropy and linkage disequilibrium.\n\nHow did knockout (removal) give these results? Counterintuitive?"

Similar selection environment could have taken different phenotypic pathways (mutation-order speciation).\nThree possible mechanisms for high isolation in sympatric species:\n\nTempleton effect/differential fusion: in sympatry, strong isolation is required for isolated populations to persist, whereas weakly isolated populations fuse.\nReinforcement: natural selection against hybrids with lower fitness\nReproductive interference: presence of sympatric species during mating (or cost of migration) could elevate prezygotic isolation\n\nAlso found asymmetry between habitat isolation and sexual isolation between allopatric species sharing the same host plant: lineage that emigrates more shows stronger habitat isolation (lower fitness of immigrants in alternative habitat) while lineage that receives more immigrants shows stronger sexual isolation (lower fitness of hybrids).\nThe three closely related wasp species are a good model for speciation research, due to their unique ecology and geography. Their framework is also useful for exploring completion of speciation, a knowledge gap."

    "text": "5.2 Schield et al 2024\n\nHow does the genetic basis of sexual selection result in barrier to gene flow in secondary contact?\nMost studies explore links between either sexual traits and reproductive isolation, or genomic divergence and genetic association with sexual traits. Not the full flow from genomic divergence to reproductive isolation via barrier to gene flow.\nFor species like Barn Swallow which are early in speciation process, sexual selection may be driving RI at small number of barrier loci involved in sexual traits.\n\nGenetic coupling of barrier loci (linkage disequilibrium) facilitates speciation, via both direct and indirect selection. With increase in coupled barrier loci, barrier to gene flow is stengthened.\nCoupling is likely to arise in allopatry, and can promote RI upon further secondary contact.\n\nBarn Swallow populations all diverged recently from the common ancestor about 11 kya, and there is strong evidence for divergent sexual selection among these populations.\n\nNot only does the species have multiple populations (subspecies), but there are also multiple hybrid zones, with varying divergence in sexual traits. These hybrid zones allow tests of whether sexual selection results in RI upon secondary contact.\nFurther, two of these hybrid zones also have divergences in nonbreeding migratory route, which is a potential coupled trait (low survival of hybrids taking nonadaptive migratory routes; i.e., hybrid fitness).\nExplicit tests of effects of trait loci on gene flow are necessary because degree of concordance between allopatric evolutionary processes and hybrid fitness is not clear a priori.\n\nDo sexual trait loci experience divergent sexual selection in allopatry and promote RI upon secondary contact? Is there LD among barrier loci (sexual traits, migratory route) in secondary contact, mainting RI via effects on hybrid fitness?\nFound that 6 ssp. cluster in 3 groups. Individuals from hybrid zones show intermediate/similar to parent plumage trait values (breast feather colour, tail streamer length) and admixture proportions.\nPrevalence of back-crossed, late generation hybrids, and demographic models, suggest that hybrid zones formed upon secondary contact following allopatry.\nrustica-gutturalis hybrid zone estimated to have formed 2000 generations ago, while the tytleri ones were more recent (&lt; 1000 generations).\nTrait variation is controlled by few loci and not several genes: both traits have high proportion of phenotypic variation explained (PVE) by SNP genotypes, and high proportion of genetic effects (PGE) by small number of SNPs.\nVentral colour SNPs on chromosome 1A and Z (genes affecting melanogenesis and feathering phenotype), whereas tail streamer length SNPs on chromosome 2 (enzymes with regulatory functions potentially affecting transcription, intracellular transport, growth factor stability).\n\nConcentration of ventral colour associations on Z chromosome (sex chromosome) supports that sex linkage is favourable for traits involved in mate choice and sexual isolation.\n\nAcross allopatric populations, sexual trait loci show more genetic differentiation (FST) than do genome-wide comparisons.\n\nThis could just be due to “background selection” in regions with reduced recombination. However, regions with extremely low recombination rates like centromeres also show higher FST in trait loci—high differentiation in trait loci is due to divergent positive selection rather than background selection alone. Elevated allelic differentitation and extended haplotype homozygosity, also suggest this.\nGreater fitness effects of ventral colour than tail streamer length.\n\nGeographic and genomic cline analysis, comparing trait loci–background loci differences across space along the three hybrid zone transects. -Found steeper transition between parental ancestries in trait loci cf background loci.\n\nSteepness itself could arise due to low population density in hybrid zones, but this would show similar clines in trait loci as in other highly differentiated loci (not the case)\nStronger selection and barrier to gene flow between rustica and other ssp.\nCline patterns are weakest in tytleri-gutturalis hybrid zone, possibly linked to absence of migratory divide between the two populations (though remains to be tested).\n\nLD arises from hybridisation, but extent of erosion of LD by recombination over generations can be impacted by selection-driven genetic coupling.\n\nThey compared interchromosomal LD between trait loci and background loci; if the LD was formed by admixture but not maintained by selection, would find similar levels between the two. But they found much higher LD levels in trait loci.\nIncrease in LD shows consistent differences between hybrid zones, with rustic hybrids showing higher.\nAlso no differences in LD between parental populations, therefore admixture important followed by selection.\nStarting levels of admixture LD higher than current levels, suggesting that selection worked by slowing erosion of LD, rather enhancing LD beyond starting levels.\n\nPrimary/major role of divergent sexual selection in genomic divergence and RI."

But how sympatry (sec. contact) can complete speciation is contested.\nRI before secondary contact: either fully complete, or costs to interactions between partially RI species (maladaptive hybridisation) may drive further divergence (reinforcement).\nProblem with complete RI prior to sympatry: takes very long time to evolve, and widepsread occurrence of hybrid zones suggests frequent contact with incomplete RI.\nAlternative is that incipient species interactions change (indirect)—any process that results in divergent character displacement, e.g., divergent agonistic selection to avoid aggressive interactions (though this could result in the opposite, convergence, if interspecific aggression helps defend against true competitors).\nAnother option is direct selection for increased RI (direct): reinforcement, i.e., selection to avoid maladaptive hybridisation. Very difficult to demonstrate its existence, so few examples. One of the hallmark indicators of reinforcement is reproductive character displacement (increased divergence in reproductive traits in sympatry than in allopatry), but this can be generated by other processes too.\nDifficult to determine whether sympatry plays a role in completion of speciation (geographic context difficult to estimate).\nCoalescent demographic modelling, whole-genome datasets. Sympatric E NA Empidonax species populations (broad sympatry) show increased RI post secondary contact—unrelated to reproductive character displacement—while western contact zone (narrow sympatry) has lower RI (higher introgression).\nMethods\n\nWhole genome data –&gt; patterns of admixture (is RI higher in broad sympatry than in narrow sympatry?), and patterns of ecological/reproductive character displacement in sympatry. Coalescent modelling –&gt; did geographic contact precede and drive increase in RI?\nBlood samples –&gt; whole-genome sequencing and genotyping-by-sequencing –&gt; alignment with Willow reference genome, generation of de no Alder genome (linked-read sequencing).\nGenomic differentiation: weighted Hudson’s F_ST_, proportion of genetic ancestry.\nGeographic contact: GBIF, WorldClim, Maxent SDMs for present climate and LGM. (Potential for range overlap.)\nCharacter displacement: morphological measurements of caught birds. Temporal displacement from spring arrival time from eBird.\n\nGenomes are well differentiated, multiple F_ST_ peaks on most chromosomes, greater in east than west. Similarly, admixture lower in east than west. RI in east not absolute but nearly complete and significantly higher than in west.\nLonger contact in east than in west, south of glaciation. Willow occurred in both but Alder (currently more N breeder) only in east. (However, range overlap in LGM not really in “east”, more central [Fig 3].)\nNo temporal character displacement. No displacement in bill/body morphology or crown feather reflectance. Only difference in crown colour—subtle, but strongest in UV, but birds unlikely to perceive this difference.\nSupport for continuous gene flow even in present day in west, but ceased long after secondary contact in east. However, model support relatively weaker in west (additional complexity).\nElevated RI could have been due to ecological divergence to avoid resource competition, agonistic selection, or reinforcement—but causal traits elusive.\nMultistage model of speciation: dynamics of initiation and completion of RI have fundamentally different dynamics and drivers.\nPotential alternative reproductive traits that could be under divergent selection: male song, and female preference for male song. Is divergence of male song stronger in sympatry? Is female preference for conspecific song higher in sympatry (reinforcing selection) as in Ficedule? Or even gametic level (sperm-related). Also need to explore costs to hybridisation like reduced fitness.\nTheir approach is one effective way to study what otherwise remains very difficult, even in non-model systems and species that no longer hybridise.\nBroad sympatry vs narrow sympatry —&gt; sympatry vs allopatry (not sure if this logical jump is appropriate)"

Is variation in hybrid fertilisation related to male and female gamete proteins? Are derived protein variants less likely to result in hybrid fertilisation than ancestral? Do allele frequencies of sperm and egg proteins in sympatry and allopatry support presence of RCD?\nNo-choice fertilisation success between conspecific and heterospecific males and females reciprocally. Choice experiments using Sd eggs, because it has higher and more variable levels of hybridisation than Mf.\nExperiment 1: no-choice + 5 choice (varying heterospecific sperm ratios) crosses. Experiment 2: no-choice + 0.9:0.1 (Mf:Sd) choice crosses (ability of sperm to fertilise eggs at greatest numerical superiority; more replicates).\nIn choice crosses, embryos developed for 3 days then genetic analysis for paternity. Survivorship compared among crosses to test for bias between early postzygotic survivorship (prior to genotyping larvae) and gametic incompatibility.\nSd more susceptible to hybrid fertilisation than Mf, and required lower concentration of heterspecific sperm. But presence of conspecific sperm reduced hybridisation—47% no hybridisation even at most extreme ratios favouring hybridisation. Concentration no longer important when both sperm present; instead, relative proportion important.\nAbove were overall/average trends, but individual results varied from absolute to nonexistent CSP. This variation was explained by the sperm genotype: presence of shared (ancestral) GG allele increased hybridisation. Higher hybridisation in presence of shared protein was seen also in egg protein, but this was not statistically significant.\nShared allele more frequent in allopatry than sympatry, but only in eggs and not in sperm bindin (greater cost of egg wastage than sperm wastage).\nInterspecific variation in sperm recognition proteins not enough to fully prevent hybrid fertilisation if given enough time and without competing sperm with higher affinity (conspecifics).\nLikely that reinforcement selection and RCD manifested more in Mf.\nSexual conflict, or generally sexual selection, generates intraspecific variation which then gets acted upon by reinforcement selection.\nDid not like the way this paper was written:\n\nBackground on the proteins: important info but could have had lay summaries too.\nOverll just too technical!\nResults too long, longer than discussion, and contains things that should be in methods (like models and tests)!\nPaper should overall have been more inferential, rather than technical reporting."

Second, used PCAs of linkage map position.\nSome phenotypic traits using standardised image analysis.

Divergence between Spanish ecotypes larger than divergence among all Swedish.\nRole of chromosomal inversions: Found multiple chromosomal inversions at same sites across countries. Although inversion patterns were congruent between the countries, more pronounced in Spain (higher blocks in Manhattan plots, stronger cluster in PCA).\nStrong phenotypic and behavioural (Crab more wary) divergence between two ecotypes, but strength lower in Sweden where Crab traits more often also seen in Wave than is the case in Spain.\nPhenotypic variation showed even more gradual cline in Spain than genomic.

B2 inversion is private to Mediterranean lagoons: intermediate haplotype frequencies, heterozygote advantage; because it is longer, more likely to have accumulated deleterious mutations, so polymorphism maintained by pseudo-overdominance.\nB12 might facilitate speciation over the long term, but uncertain whether B2 will undergo differential fixation between habitats or universal fixation of one haplotype."

Related to positive selection and meiotic drive.\nIn guenons, which hybridise a lot in the past and present, males disperse after maturation, giving opportunities for introgression across species boundaries. Maternal introgression cases already known in these organisms.\nWGS two guenon species (Cercopithecus denti, C. wolfi) to add to recent dataset, and resequenced two others.\nWhy compared against rhesus macaque? Why not another species from the same continent, near relative?\nSaw mitonuclear discordance, but Y tree was very similar to species tree, in line with Haldane’s rule—except for C. denti which in the Y tree was closest to C. mitis and not C. wolfi.\nTo distinguish between introgression and ILS, compared pairwise nucleotide differences (dxy), and found that nucleotide divergence was 3.6 times greater on autosomes than Y (suggesting introgression from mitis into denti).\nAutosomal gene flow tested using D-statistic, and found overall low levels of allele sharing between mitis and denti, suggesting that the mitis-like Y chromosome in denti was initially introduced at a low frequency.\nThen compared neutral (drift) and non-neutral processes using simulations (multi-species-coalescence-with-introgression, MSci). Low initial frequency but selective force allowed fixation.\nLooked for possible targets of selection in Y-linked genes with amino acid substitutions in the different lineages. Found potential in genes linked to sperm competition.\nTried to compare adaptive introgression with meiotic drive, but didn’t get conclusive results that suggest one over the other."

Generally, chromosomes 9 and 18, with broad cellular functions. Strongest differential selection, nearing fixation, associated with growth, reproductive processes, and pigmentation.\nSpecifically, might be related to thermogenic adaptations. Lipid metabolism in Brown Skua, fatty acid degradation and metabolic pathways in SP Skua, glycerolipid metabolism in Chilean. Traits: ability to endure extreme temperatures, prolonged periods without food, various environmental pressures.\nSDMs predict changes for all species, and this will change overlaps and therefore introgression.

However, diets of individual snake species are narrower than those of lizard species. Snakes also feed much less than lizards on adults of insects.\nWhile morphology and diet seem to have diverged in snakes from lizards, climatic niche and life history haven’t changed much.\nSnakes show higher speciation rates than lizards (CLaDS, BAMM), but this is not linked to richness or individual traits. In latter case, potential statistical confound with the singularity at the origin of snakes and the most successful Colubriformes radiation.\nSnakes are an ongoing radiation characterised by sustained ecological and species (adaptive) diversification, earlier on triggered by one or more singular events.\nImportance of dramatic shifts in tempo and mode; extrapolating contemporary microevolution through geological time may not give us the right answers."

These are now very much linked to the concept of magic traits, for which there has been much evidence.\n\n\n2.2.3 Outstanding problem\nAdditional requirements for sympatric speciation are that they need to be sister species, and we need to be sure that past allopatry was unlikely. This has been more difficult to show, and many popular examples fail here.\nLake Victoria cichlids had crazy sympatric speciation possible due to a combination of factors like trophic divergence, sexual selection, and microallopatry. However, there is controversy around the idea that they are only 14,000 years old—some people don’t think the lake fully dried out.\nIn the case of Rhagoletis fruit flies, which have sympatric differentiation in host plant choice (between hawthorn and apple; GL Bush), it turned out that they were actually allopatric at some point and only the completion of the speciation process happened in sympatry (Feder et al 2003).\nSimilarly, in the case of stickleback ecomorphs in postglacial lakes, secondary contact drove character displacement and resulted in sister species, even though completion was in sympatry (Rundle & Schulter 2004).\nThus, more and more evidence has piled up to transform the dichotomy from sympatric vs allopatric speciation, to primary sympatric divergence vs secondary contact introgression."

This includes things like habitat isolation, where say niche of hybrids falls somewhere between parental lineages but fitness of hybrids is lower than that of either parent. But in some cases, hybrids may have higher fitness in intermediate habitats, which would explain the increase in hybridisation in the first place.\nIn stickleback crossing studies, Rundle 2002 found that F1s were bad (relative to parents), but F1-parent backcrosses yielded some fitter individuals (proportional to how much parental heredity the cross had).\nOther times, hybrids could have higher disease susceptibility, or intermediate traits that are less attractive (sexual selection)."

    "text": "4.2 Intrinsic postzygotic isolation\nInternal to the individual/organism, so quite simply, developmental defects lead to hybrid sterility or inviability.\nIt can be meiosis issues related to ploidy levels, where hybrids like F1s simply cannot perform meiosis. Or chromosomal rearrangements/inversions like in Australian morabine grasshoppers (White 1978). However, many inversions surprisingly have no effect on heterozygote fitness, because recombination can still happen in other regions of genome.\nOther mechanisms include endosymbiotic infection risk for hybrids, or cytoplasmic incompatibilities especially relating to parasites (e.g., intracellular parasites like Wolbachia: when uninfected female flies are crossed with infected males, many/all progeny die, but infection transmitted from mother so those that are born from infected females are infected). There can even be mitonuclear incompatibilities (i.e., between mitochrondrial and cytoplasmic genetic material), famously in copepods (Ron Burton), so much so that Geoffrey Hill even introduced a mitonuclear compatibility species concept.\nAllelic incompatibilities are a major way intrinsic postzygotic isolation can occur. The original definition of Dobzhansky-Muller Incompatibility focused on alleles at different loci, arguing that low hybrid fitness is a byproduct of genomes that are geographically isolated. The newer, more specific definition emphasises epistasis (effects of an allele at one locus depend on alleles present at other loci), arguing that negative epistatic interactions occur between alleles of different loci with different evolutionary histories. Some assumptions of this theory are that there occurs at least one pair of allele changes, that most incompatibilities are due to derived alleles, and that the no. if incompatible combinations snowballs over time.\n\n4.2.1 Haldane’s Rule\nRule about sex chromosome incompatibilities; it is an exception, because there are very rare exceptions to the rule. Basically: in offspring of two different races, if one (and only one) sex is messed up (absent, rare, or sterile) then that is the heterozygous sex.\nNOT caused by: incompatibilities between X- and Y-linked genes; dosage compensation (compensate based on importance of stuff on X); chromosomal arrangement.\nPossible causes:\n\nDominance: in XY species, hybrid males are affected by all X-linked genes involved in genic incompatibilities, whereas hybrid females are affected only by dominant X-linked genes\nFaster-males: in XY species, incompatibilities affecting XY hybrids accumulate more quickly (but exceptions to this, so doesn’t satisfactorily explain)\nFaster-X: faster drift at population levels because more X than Y in population (thus this mechanism interacts with dominance)\nMeiotic drive: distorter alleles that distort Mendelian ratios to their own advantage; suppressors evolve to stop them. When two allopatric populations each independently evolve a driver and suppressor, suppressed drivers can become unmasked."

(e.g., does having many great effect genes at few nearby loci facilitate more reinforcement (magic traits)?\n\nLots of work in this area, including on Drosophila from Dobzhansky & Koller 1938 (western US) to Matute 2010 (Sao Tome & Principe), and bindin protein in sea urchins. In the case of the Ficedula flycatchers, male plumage is driven by female choice (because females in sympatry are not different, only males are), and this is just females being choosier than males (fewer eggs than sperm). However, it is not fully clear whether the brown in Pied males evolved to enhance isolation from sympatric Collared, or whether it’s just female-mimicry in order to reduce intermale aggression. This is the more going on in this case.\nThe genetic basis of reinforcement has been reviewed in Garner et al 2018, and consists of genetic divergence both within species (allopatric vs sympatric contrasts) and between species (greater in sympatry, lower in allopatry). One example is flower colour in Phlox wildflowers, where colour is driven by two loci (intensity and hue), but selection happens on the intensity one."

    "text": "6.1 Historical demography of speciation\nGenetic studies of speciation often infer the species tree from gene trees. Divergence time for the genes is always older than for the species. Trees made with different genes may be different and have disagreements (is this a methods issue, or the actual population demographics, or are they important factors driving speciation itself?). Moreover, gene trees can be complicated by mixing after divergence. So all this variation needs to be accounted for.\nHistorical demography helps us infer about population size, changes in population size, divergence genetics, and isolation and hybridisation. In this demographic context, certain terms have specific meanings. Population size is considered an indication of genetic variation, with larger populations holding more genetic variation. Genetic diversity is commonly denoted as \\(\\theta\\), but there are multiple metrics used."

Based on the number of segregating sites (polymorphisms) in a DNA sample.\nTajima’s \\(\\theta_\\pi\\): Based on frequency so rare alleles don’t matter. Observed nucleotide diversity: average number of differences between pairs of sequences in a DNA sample.\nTajima’s \\(D\\) gives an overall measure. Premise is that under neutrality (observed diversity matching expected diversity), \\(D = 0\\). \\(D \\lt 0\\) means more rare alleles than expected (negative selection), suggesting bottleneck (multiple loci) or selective sweep (single locus). During selective sweep, when \\(D\\) drops, linkage disequilibrium rises. Biston betularia is a classic example of selective sweep. \\(D \\gt 0\\) means few rare alleles, suggesting balancing selection (e.g., malaria resistance) or overdominant selection. If you follow a certain selective pressure over time, \\(D\\) would go from negative to positive.\nMismatch distribution (Rogers & Harpending 1992): quantify mismatches between individuals in a population for each locus, and visualise like a histogram. A clustered peak shows sudden high mutation event; so we can estimate divergence time (e.g., bottleneck in exploding population). This requires examining non-recombining bits of DNA, and earlier mitochondrial DNA was used for this, but nowadays it’s the Y chromosome.\nSite/allele frequency spectrum: distribution of allele frequencies for all segregatng sites in a sample of DNA sequences. Certain demographic scenarios like bottleneck would result in allele frequency distribution (using combined polymorphism data) close to 0 for 2nd most common allele (i.e., minor allele in biallelic). We can compare frequency with reference of outgroup (unfolded) to infer derived vs ancestral.\nSynteny: conservation of blocks of (gene) order between two sets of chromosomes being compared."

It is based on coalescent theory, where all the lineages present today coalesce going back to one common ancestor. Using only the present-day observed lineages helps because we can ignore others from past who didn’t make it (simplifies compute). Smaller (pop. size) and younger lineages would coalesce faster. We can also get gene history or gene geneaology along the same steps.\nThis can be used to test for no isolation between population, by looking for \\(t = 0\\) (divergence time). Similarly, it can test for no migration (genetic exchange), if \\(m_1 = m_2 = 0\\). On the other hand, it can also estimate values for these parameters for conditions of isolation and migration."

One alternative is DaDi (Diffusion Approximations for Demographic Inference), which allows more than one value for each parameter. However, this is a different framework, because it works by model comparison between numerous fixed (prespecified) models. So it is also important to remove very unlikely models from the starting options.\nModel selection is typically done using AIC (\\(AIC = 2k - 2l\\)) where \\(k\\) (complexity) is number of parameters and \\(l\\) (fit) is log-likelihood of data under model.
