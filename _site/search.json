    "text": "3.1 Coathup et al 2024\n\nTheory says sympatric speciation facilitated by magic traits which might be encoded by pleiotropic genes, but little evidence exists of sympatric speciation and empirical evidence of magic traits is rare. Authors investigated role of pleitropy in Howea speciation. They found multiple genes showing adaptive divergence between the sister species (sign of pleiotropy, in soil stress tolerance and flowering time).\nAlternative to magic traits/pleiotropy driving sympatric ecological speciation is linkage disequilibrium. (i.e., one allele with multiple effects vs two close alleles not separated in recombination.) In either case, “major effect loci”.\nDunning et al 2016 and Osborne et al 2019 assessed gene expression and genetic divergence. They identified candidate pleiotropic speciation genes. The current study aimed to test whether these genes actually are pleiotropic loci affecting soil stress tolerance and flowering time. If so, this would be positive evidence for magic traits.\nMethod: T-DNA knockout A. thaliana used for high-throughput phenotyping (knockouts in orthologues of candidate speciation genes, 11 knockout mutants).\n\nGrown under various stress emulating Lord Howe Island. Then morphology, stress responses and flowering time measured.\n\nFive genes potential speciation genes: knockouts in each of these showed displaced flowering times and altered soil stress response (cadmium, drought, salt). Largest effect sizes in SAL1 (latest flowering) and SIZ1 (earliest flowering)\n\nKnockout of SIZ1 caused reduced drought tolerance. H. belmoreana has lower expression of the two SIZ1 homologues and also cannot colonise calcareous soils. On the other hand, knockout of SAL1 caused increased drought tolerance (consistent with H. forsteriana), but reduced salt tolerance which doesn’t match with Howea scenario—so less evidence for this locus driving sympatric speciation cf SIZ1.\n\nRobust example of genetic architecture of sympatric speciation. Evidence of pleiotropy in multiple loci, so could be a combination of pleiotropy and linkage disequilibrium.\n\nHow did knockout (removal) give these results? Counterintuitive?"

The authors compare two ecotypes of three-spined stickleback (no, multiple species-pairs?) using morphological data, targeted genotyping and genome-wide SNP data.\n\nThe two ecotypes show extensive hybridisation in sympatry/parapary.\nThere are rare cases of complete reproductive isolation in sticklebacks, but these cases involve ancient allopatric origins.\n\nImportance of genetic admixture upon secondary contact widely known in plants since 1970s, but has also started gaining popularity in animals.\n\nClassic examples like Darwin’s finches, Lake Victoria cichlids and Anopheles species complex all either involved genetic admixture events or are cryptic cases of homoploid hybrid speciation.\n\nOverwhelming evidence for ancient allopatry, and against “true” sympatric ecological speciation. (And authors found the same.)\nThey find that the two ecotypes are strongly reproductively isolated, but also a complex colonisation history suggesting admixture upon secondary contact in addition to disruptive ecological selection (i.e., older allopatric origin).\nThree hypotheses (none consider sympatric speciation option? wait, the first classic one probably is)\nCompelling morphological and genetic evidence of unusually strong reproductive isolation between lagoon resident and anadromous stickleback, in spite of (low) gene flow. Classic purely-ecological speciation model (relative sea level change) unlikely; at least two colonisation and therefore admixture upon secondary contact (alongside strong selection for maintenance of differentiation, i.e. partial ecological basis)\nReproductive isolation in this island species-pair example is considerably stronger than most other stickleback examples, so this could potentially be a very useful system to work further on these questions.\nAlso evidence against “linear, bifurcating process” model.\n\nSpecies pairs?

In host plant divergence, does sympatry yield higher RI than allopatry (due to selection for reduced migration and reduced hybridisation)?\nMeasured “degree of sexual isolation in the absence of host plant”\nNatural temporal difference in the wasp species, so they stored some galls at 4 dec C for one week which delayed the emergence.

Similar selection environment could have taken different phenotypic pathways (mutation-order speciation).\nThree possible mechanisms for high isolation in sympatric species:\n\nTempleton effect/differential fusion: in sympatry, strong isolation is required for isolated populations to persist, whereas weakly isolated populations fuse.\nReinforcement: natural selection against hybrids with lower fitness\nReproductive interference: presence of sympatric species during mating (or cost of migration) could elevate prezygotic isolation\n\nAlso found asymmetry between habitat isolation and sexual isolation between allopatric species sharing the same host plant: lineage that emigrates more shows stronger habitat isolation (lower fitness of immigrants in alternative habitat) while lineage that receives more immigrants shows stronger sexual isolation (lower fitness of hybrids).\nThe three closely related wasp species are a good model for speciation research, due to their unique ecology and geography. Their framework is also useful for exploring completion of speciation, a knowledge gap."

    "text": "5.2 Schield et al 2024\n\nHow does the genetic basis of sexual selection result in barrier to gene flow in secondary contact?\nMost studies explore links between either sexual traits and reproductive isolation, or genomic divergence and genetic association with sexual traits. Not the full flow from genomic divergence to reproductive isolation via barrier to gene flow.\nFor species like Barn Swallow which are early in speciation process, sexual selection may be driving RI at small number of barrier loci involved in sexual traits.\n\nGenetic coupling of barrier loci (linkage disequilibrium) facilitates speciation, via both direct and indirect selection. With increase in coupled barrier loci, barrier to gene flow is stengthened.\nCoupling is likely to arise in allopatry, and can promote RI upon further secondary contact.\n\nBarn Swallow populations all diverged recently from the common ancestor about 11 kya, and there is strong evidence for divergent sexual selection among these populations.\n\nNot only does the species have multiple populations (subspecies), but there are also multiple hybrid zones, with varying divergence in sexual traits. These hybrid zones allow tests of whether sexual selection results in RI upon secondary contact.\nFurther, two of these hybrid zones also have divergences in nonbreeding migratory route, which is a potential coupled trait (low survival of hybrids taking nonadaptive migratory routes; i.e., hybrid fitness).\nExplicit tests of effects of trait loci on gene flow are necessary because degree of concordance between allopatric evolutionary processes and hybrid fitness is not clear a priori.\n\nDo sexual trait loci experience divergent sexual selection in allopatry and promote RI upon secondary contact? Is there LD among barrier loci (sexual traits, migratory route) in secondary contact, mainting RI via effects on hybrid fitness?\nFound that 6 ssp. cluster in 3 groups. Individuals from hybrid zones show intermediate/similar to parent plumage trait values (breast feather colour, tail streamer length) and admixture proportions.\nPrevalence of back-crossed, late generation hybrids, and demographic models, suggest that hybrid zones formed upon secondary contact following allopatry.\nrustica-gutturalis hybrid zone estimated to have formed 2000 generations ago, while the tytleri ones were more recent (&lt; 1000 generations).\nTrait variation is controlled by few loci and not several genes: both traits have high proportion of phenotypic variation explained (PVE) by SNP genotypes, and high proportion of genetic effects (PGE) by small number of SNPs.\nVentral colour SNPs on chromosome 1A and Z (genes affecting melanogenesis and feathering phenotype), whereas tail streamer length SNPs on chromosome 2 (enzymes with regulatory functions potentially affecting transcription, intracellular transport, growth factor stability).\n\nConcentration of ventral colour associations on Z chromosome (sex chromosome) supports that sex linkage is favourable for traits involved in mate choice and sexual isolation.\n\nAcross allopatric populations, sexual trait loci show more genetic differentiation (FST) than do genome-wide comparisons.\n\nThis could just be due to “background selection” in regions with reduced recombination. However, regions with extremely low recombination rates like centromeres also show higher FST in trait loci—high differentiation in trait loci is due to divergent positive selection rather than background selection alone. Elevated allelic differentitation and extended haplotype homozygosity, also suggest this.\nGreater fitness effects of ventral colour than tail streamer length.\n\nGeographic and genomic cline analysis, comparing trait loci–background loci differences across space along the three hybrid zone transects. -Found steeper transition between parental ancestries in trait loci cf background loci.\n\nSteepness itself could arise due to low population density in hybrid zones, but this would show similar clines in trait loci as in other highly differentiated loci (not the case)\nStronger selection and barrier to gene flow between rustica and other ssp.\nCline patterns are weakest in tytleri-gutturalis hybrid zone, possibly linked to absence of migratory divide between the two populations (though remains to be tested).\n\nLD arises from hybridisation, but extent of erosion of LD by recombination over generations can be impacted by selection-driven genetic coupling.\n\nThey compared interchromosomal LD between trait loci and background loci; if the LD was formed by admixture but not maintained by selection, would find similar levels between the two. But they found much higher LD levels in trait loci.\nIncrease in LD shows consistent differences between hybrid zones, with rustic hybrids showing higher.\nAlso no differences in LD between parental populations, therefore admixture important followed by selection.\nStarting levels of admixture LD higher than current levels, suggesting that selection worked by slowing erosion of LD, rather enhancing LD beyond starting levels.\n\nPrimary/major role of divergent sexual selection in genomic divergence and RI."

But how sympatry (sec. contact) can complete speciation is contested.\nRI before secondary contact: either fully complete, or costs to interactions between partially RI species (maladaptive hybridisation) may drive further divergence (reinforcement).\nProblem with complete RI prior to sympatry: takes very long time to evolve, and widepsread occurrence of hybrid zones suggests frequent contact with incomplete RI.\nAlternative is that incipient species interactions change (indirect)—any process that results in divergent character displacement, e.g., divergent agonistic selection to avoid aggressive interactions (though this could result in the opposite, convergence, if interspecific aggression helps defend against true competitors).\nAnother option is direct selection for increased RI (direct): reinforcement, i.e., selection to avoid maladaptive hybridisation. Very difficult to demonstrate its existence, so few examples. One of the hallmark indicators of reinforcement is reproductive character displacement (increased divergence in reproductive traits in sympatry than in allopatry), but this can be generated by other processes too.\nDifficult to determine whether sympatry plays a role in completion of speciation (geographic context difficult to estimate).\nCoalescent demographic modelling, whole-genome datasets. Sympatric E NA Empidonax species populations (broad sympatry) show increased RI post secondary contact—unrelated to reproductive character displacement—while western contact zone (narrow sympatry) has lower RI (higher introgression).\nMethods\n\nWhole genome data –&gt; patterns of admixture (is RI higher in broad sympatry than in narrow sympatry?), and patterns of ecological/reproductive character displacement in sympatry. Coalescent modelling –&gt; did geographic contact precede and drive increase in RI?\nBlood samples –&gt; whole-genome sequencing and genotyping-by-sequencing –&gt; alignment with Willow reference genome, generation of de no Alder genome (linked-read sequencing).\nGenomic differentiation: weighted Hudson’s F_ST_, proportion of genetic ancestry.\nGeographic contact: GBIF, WorldClim, Maxent SDMs for present climate and LGM. (Potential for range overlap.)\nCharacter displacement: morphological measurements of caught birds. Temporal displacement from spring arrival time from eBird.\n\nGenomes are well differentiated, multiple F_ST_ peaks on most chromosomes, greater in east than west. Similarly, admixture lower in east than west. RI in east not absolute but nearly complete and significantly higher than in west.\nLonger contact in east than in west, south of glaciation. Willow occurred in both but Alder (currently more N breeder) only in east. (However, range overlap in LGM not really in “east”, more central [Fig 3].)\nNo temporal character displacement. No displacement in bill/body morphology or crown feather reflectance. Only difference in crown colour—subtle, but strongest in UV, but birds unlikely to perceive this difference.\nSupport for continuous gene flow even in present day in west, but ceased long after secondary contact in east. However, model support relatively weaker in west (additional complexity).\nElevated RI could have been due to ecological divergence to avoid resource competition, agonistic selection, or reinforcement—but causal traits elusive.\nMultistage model of speciation: dynamics of initiation and completion of RI have fundamentally different dynamics and drivers.\nPotential alternative reproductive traits that could be under divergent selection: male song, and female preference for male song. Is divergence of male song stronger in sympatry? Is female preference for conspecific song higher in sympatry (reinforcing selection) as in Ficedule? Or even gametic level (sperm-related). Also need to explore costs to hybridisation like reduced fitness.\nTheir approach is one effective way to study what otherwise remains very difficult, even in non-model systems and species that no longer hybridise.\nBroad sympatry vs narrow sympatry —&gt; sympatry vs allopatry (not sure if this logical jump is appropriate)"

But although this generates variation, not sufficient to explain very low compatibility preventing/limiting hybridisation.\nTwo urchin species can produce F1 embryos; Sd eggs more susceptible than Mf; former can metamorphose into juveniles but magnitudes lower than conspecifics (no introgression between the two species).\nTested for conspecific sperm precedence (CSP) using no-choice and competitive choice assays. Is variation in hybrid fertilisation related to male and female gamete proteins? Are derived protein variants less likely to result in hybrid fertilisation than ancestral? Do allele frequencies of sperm and egg proteins in sympatry and allopatry support presence of RCD?\nNo-choice fertilisation success between conspecific and heterospecific males and females reciprocally. Choice experiments using Sd eggs, because it has higher and more variable levels of hybridisation than Mf.\nExperiment 1: no-choice + 5 choice (varying heterospecific sperm ratios) crosses. Experiment 2: no-choice + 0.9:0.1 (Mf:Sd) choice crosses (ability of sperm to fertilise eggs at greatest numerical superiority; more replicates).\nIn choice crosses, embryos developed for 3 days then genetic analysis for paternity. Survivorship compared among crosses to test for bias between early postzygotic survivorship (prior to genotyping larvae) and gametic incompatibility.\nSd more susceptible to hybrid fertilisation than Mf, and required lower concentration of heterspecific sperm. But presence of conspecific sperm reduced hybridisation—47% no hybridisation even at most extreme ratios favouring hybridisation. Concentration no longer important when both sperm present; instead, relative proportion important.\nAbove were overall/average trends, but individual results varied from absolute to nonexistent CSP. This variation was explained by the sperm genotype: presence of shared (ancestral) GG allele increased hybridisation. Higher hybridisation in presence of shared protein was seen also in egg protein, but this was not statistically significant.\nShared allele more frequent in allopatry than sympatry, but only in eggs and not in sperm bindin (greater cost of egg wastage than sperm wastage).\nInterspecific variation in sperm recognition proteins not enough to fully prevent hybrid fertilisation if given enough time and without competing sperm with higher affinity (conspecifics).\nLikely that reinforcement selection and RCD manifested more in Mf.\nSexual conflict, or generally sexual selection, generates intraspecific variation which then gets acted upon by reinforcement selection.\nDid not like the way this paper was written:\n\nBackground on the proteins: important info but could have had lay summaries too.\nOverll just too technical!\nResults too long, longer than discussion, and contains things that should be in methods (like models and tests)!\nPaper should overall have been more inferential, rather than technical reporting."

This is an especially true/useful approach for bacteria: different bacteria can occupy very different niches and have no gene flow, but act/behave the same in terms of where they are found, physiology, etc.\n\n\n\nFocuses on evolutionary independence, and considers species as segments of population-level variation?\n\n\n\nSpecies are not real!\nSome perspectives/justifications for this view:\n\nTaxonomic perspective: subspecies may be elevated to species, but still grade into each other so don’t hold much meaning\nConsider populations as evolutionary units, not species\nSpatial and temporal forms that are not easy to tell apart as species vs not.\nGenetic markers: gene flow too low to maintain cohesion\nPhenetics\n\n\n\n\nHellberg’s operational definition is based on genotypic cluster criterion (Mallet 1995). The emphasis is on how combinations of traits cluster separately or together between groups. What’s critical is the presence of genotypic gaps between local populations, so this concept makes sense for sympatric populations but not so much for allopatric ones.\nIt can be pictured as a bimodal distribution of traits. This view relies on Bayesian stats, using “assignment tests” and so on."

His model system was Indopacific wrasses, and he had ideas about allopatric speciation well before Ernst Mayr. He believed: given any species in any region, nearest related species not likely to be found in the same region but in a neighbouring district separated from the first by a barrier of some sort. A demonstrative example was squirrels in the Grand Canyon.\nErnst Mayr was a big proponent of allopatry, and specifically peripatry. He emphasised the role of drift in populations. Model systems were birds of paradise and Dicrurus in SE Asia.\nThis has been the preferred model for multiple reasons:\n\nEasier: no gene flow to contend with\nLots of opportunities in nature for allopatry\nLots of evidence:\n\nYoung sister species tend to be allopatric\nConcordance between geography and species borders\nExtension of above: Geographic coincidence of multiple separations of sister species and/or hybrid zones (one barrier/feature showing up again separating multiple groups of species)\nIncrease in reproductive isolation in allopatry\n\n\nHowever, even in this model, not incorporating explicit selection (i.e., relying only on drift/mutation) into calculations of species generation times results in very long times."

In sympatry, need to avoid recombination by mating differentially.\nEcological problem: Ecological patterns like coexistence, competitive exclusion (Gause’s Rule) occur because in sympatry need to live differently enough from others.\n\n\n2.2.2 Solutions\nDisruptive sexual selection; disruptive natural selection (mating is linked to habitat, and the fewer genes [of large effect] the better). These are now very much linked to the concept of magic traits, for which there has been much evidence.\n\n\n2.2.3 Outstanding problem\nAdditional requirements for sympatric speciation are that they need to be sister species, and we need to be sure that past allopatry was unlikely. This has been more difficult to show, and many popular examples fail here.\nLake Victoria cichlids had crazy sympatric speciation possible due to a combination of factors like trophic divergence, sexual selection, and microallopatry. However, there is controversy around the idea that they are only 14,000 years old—some people don’t think the lake fully dried out.\nIn the case of Rhagoletis fruit flies, which have sympatric differentiation in host plant choice (between hawthorn and apple; GL Bush), it turned out that they were actually allopatric at some point and only the completion of the speciation process happened in sympatry (Feder et al 2003).\nSimilarly, in the case of stickleback ecomorphs in postglacial lakes, secondary contact drove character displacement and resulted in sister species, even though completion was in sympatry (Rundle & Schulter 2004).\nThus, more and more evidence has piled up to transform the dichotomy from sympatric vs allopatric speciation, to primary sympatric divergence vs secondary contact introgression."

This includes things like habitat isolation, where say niche of hybrids falls somewhere between parental lineages but fitness of hybrids is lower than that of either parent. But in some cases, hybrids may have higher fitness in intermediate habitats, which would explain the increase in hybridisation in the first place.\nIn stickleback crossing studies, Rundle 2002 found that F1s were bad (relative to parents), but F1-parent backcrosses yielded some fitter individuals (proportional to how much parental heredity the cross had).\nOther times, hybrids could have higher disease susceptibility, or intermediate traits that are less attractive (sexual selection)."

    "text": "4.2 Intrinsic postzygotic isolation\nInternal to the individual/organism, so quite simply, developmental defects lead to hybrid sterility or inviability.\nIt can be meiosis issues related to ploidy levels, where hybrids like F1s simply cannot perform meiosis. Or chromosomal rearrangements/inversions like in Australian morabine grasshoppers (White 1978). However, many inversions surprisingly have no effect on heterozygote fitness, because recombination can still happen in other regions of genome.\nOther mechanisms include endosymbiotic infection risk for hybrids, or cytoplasmic incompatibilities especially relating to parasites (e.g., intracellular parasites like Wolbachia: when uninfected female flies are crossed with infected males, many/all progeny die, but infection transmitted from mother so those that are born from infected females are infected). There can even be mitonuclear incompatibilities (i.e., between mitochrondrial and cytoplasmic genetic material), famously in copepods (Ron Burton), so much so that Geoffrey Hill even introduced a mitonuclear compatibility species concept.\nAllelic incompatibilities are a major way intrinsic postzygotic isolation can occur. The original definition of Dobzhansky-Muller Incompatibility focused on alleles at different loci, arguing that low hybrid fitness is a byproduct of genomes that are geographically isolated. The newer, more specific definition emphasises epistasis (effects of an allele at one locus depend on alleles present at other loci), arguing that negative epistatic interactions occur between alleles of different loci with different evolutionary histories. Some assumptions of this theory are that there occurs at least one pair of allele changes, that most incompatibilities are due to derived alleles(?), and that the no. if incompatible combinations snowballs over time.\n\n4.2.1 Haldane’s Rule\nRule about sex chromosome incompatibilities; it is an exception, because there are very rare exceptions to the rule. Basically: in offspring of two different races, if one (and only one) sex is messed up (absent, rare, or sterile) then that is the heterozygous sex.\nNOT caused by: incompatibilities between X- and Y-linked genes; dosage compensation (compensate based on importance of stuff on X); chromosomal arrangement.\nPossible causes:\n\nDominance: in XY species, hybrid males are affected by all X-linked genes involved in genic incompatibilities, whereas hybrid females are affected only by dominant X-linked genes\nFaster-males: in XY species, incompatibilities affecting XY hybrids accumulate more quickly (but exceptions to this, so doesn’t satisfactorily explain)\nFaster-X: faster drift at population levels because more X than Y in population (thus this mechanism interacts with dominance)\nMeiotic drive: distorter alleles that distort Mendelian ratios to their own advantage; suppressors evolve to stop them. When two allopatric populations each independently evolve a driver and suppressor, suppressed drivers can become unmasked."

(e.g., does having many great effect genes at few nearby loci facilitate more reinforcement (magic traits)?\n\nLots of work in this area, including on Drosophila from Dobzhansky & Koller 1938 (western US) to Matute 2010 (Sao Tome & Principe), and bindin protein in sea urchins. In the case of the Ficedula flycatchers, male plumage is driven by female choice (because females in sympatry are not different, only males are), and this is just females being choosier than males (fewer eggs than sperm). However, it is not fully clear whether the brown in Pied males evolved to enhance isolation from sympatric Collared, or whether it’s just female-mimicry in order to reduce intermale aggression. This is the more going on in this case.\nThe genetic basis of reinforcement has been reviewed in Garner et al 2018, and consists of genetic divergence both within species (allopatric vs sympatric contrasts) and between species (greater in sympatry, lower in allopatry). One example is flower colour in Phlox wildflowers, where colour is driven by two loci (intensity and hue), but selection happens on the intensity one."

Demographic purpose definitions are:\n\nPopulation size: larger populations hold more genetic variation\n\\(\\theta\\): common measure of genetic diversity, but people measure it in different ways (confusing but also revealing)\n\\(\\theta = 4 N_e u\\) where \\(N_e\\) is the effective population size (size of an idealised population that would show the same degree of drift as observed), and \\(u\\) is substitution rate (sometimes aka mutation rate)\nTajima’s \\(\\theta\\) based on frequency so rare alleles don’t matter, Waterson’s ignores frequencies and is strongly affected by rare alleles.\n\nSo Tajima’s \\(D\\) gives an overall measure.
