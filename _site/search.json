    "text": "Mallet 2013\n\n\n\n\n\nFoote 2018\n\nSympatric speciation does not involve physical/geographic barriers, so offers insights into role of selection (natural and sexual) in driving speciation.\nThis speciation (divergence with gene flow) is therefore rare, extreme, restrictive, and controversial.\nGenomic methods have provided evidence of two kinds: either multiple colonisations and secondary contact, or actual sympatric divergence.\nAuthor overall argues for less focus on primary vs secondary contact as driving speciation, and more on mechanistic aspects of genomic architecture.\nPrevious methods used phylogenetics to infer sympatric speciation from monophyly, but monophyly is not a good indicator of sympatric speciation (consistent with, but not exclusive to). (One flaw of Coyne & Orr’s criteria.)\nBackwards-in-time approaches are limited to identifying gene flow events arising through coalescence. They cannot distinguish between periods of spatial isolation and of spatial overlap with on gene flow.\nIn cases of actual sympatric speciation, we expect barrier loci to be clustered tightly (close together) in the genome, and at areas of low recombination, and to have a “large effect” especially affecting both reproductive isolation and ecological adaptation. That is, linkage or pleiotropy. Otherwise, ongoing gene flow (recombination, genome-wide homogenisation) would make it difficult for divergence.\nModern genomic methods are still biased towards disproving (and not supporting) primary sympatric speciation. Palaeogenomics is a useful tool to tackle this.\nAuthor argues that focus should be placed on sympatric speciation, and away from primary vs secondary."
