    "text": "3.1 Coathup et al 2024\n\nTheory says sympatric speciation facilitated by magic traits which might be encoded by pleiotropic genes, but little evidence exists of sympatric speciation and empirical evidence of magic traits is rare. Authors investigated role of pleitropy in Howea speciation. They found multiple genes showing adaptive divergence between the sister species (sign of pleiotropy, in soil stress tolerance and flowering time).\nAlternative to magic traits/pleiotropy driving sympatric ecological speciation is linkage disequilibrium. (i.e., one allele with multiple effects vs two close alleles not separated in recombination.) In either case, “major effect loci”.\nDunning et al 2016 and Osborne et al 2019 assessed gene expression and genetic divergence. They identified candidate pleiotropic speciation genes. The current study aimed to test whether these genes actually are pleiotropic loci affecting soil stress tolerance and flowering time. If so, this would be positive evidence for magic traits.\nMethod: T-DNA knockout A. thaliana used for high-throughput phenotyping (knockouts in orthologues of candidate speciation genes, 11 knockout mutants).\n\nGrown under various stress emulating Lord Howe Island. Then morphology, stress responses and flowering time measured.\n\nFive genes potential speciation genes: knockouts in each of these showed displaced flowering times and altered soil stress response (cadmium, drought, salt). Largest effect sizes in SAL1 (latest flowering) and SIZ1 (earliest flowering)\n\nKnockout of SIZ1 caused reduced drought tolerance. H. belmoreana has lower expression of the two SIZ1 homologues and also cannot colonise calcareous soils. On the other hand, knockout of SAL1 caused increased drought tolerance (consistent with H. forsteriana), but reduced salt tolerance which doesn’t match with Howea scenario—so less evidence for this locus driving sympatric speciation cf SIZ1.\n\nRobust example of genetic architecture of sympatric speciation. Evidence of pleiotropy in multiple loci, so could be a combination of pleiotropy and linkage disequilibrium.\n\nHow did knockout (removal) give these results? Counterintuitive?"

    "text": "3.2 Dean et al 2019\n\nAn assumption when considering sympatric species pairs is that they originated from a recent, genetically homogenous ancestor, but most evidence invokes introgression/admixture upon secondary contact as responsible for speciation. The authors compare two ecotypes of three-spined stickleback (no, multiple species-pairs?) using morphological data, targeted genotyping and genome-wide SNP data.\n\nThe two ecotypes show extensive hybridisation in sympatry/parapary.\nThere are rare cases of complete reproductive isolation in sticklebacks, but these cases involve ancient allopatric origins.\n\nImportance of genetic admixture upon secondary contact widely known in plants since 1970s, but has also started gaining popularity in animals.\n\nClassic examples like Darwin’s finches, Lake Victoria cichlids and Anopheles species complex all either involved genetic admixture events or are cryptic cases of homoploid hybrid speciation.\n\nOverwhelming evidence for ancient allopatry, and against “true” sympatric ecological speciation. (And authors found the same.)\nThey find that the two ecotypes are strongly reproductively isolated, but also a complex colonisation history suggesting admixture upon secondary contact in addition to disruptive ecological selection (i.e., older allopatric origin).\nThree hypotheses (none consider sympatric speciation option? wait, the first classic one probably is)\nCompelling morphological and genetic evidence of unusually strong reproductive isolation between lagoon resident and anadromous stickleback, in spite of (low) gene flow. Classic purely-ecological speciation model (relative sea level change) unlikely; at least two colonisation and therefore admixture upon secondary contact (alongside strong selection for maintenance of differentiation, i.e. partial ecological basis)\nReproductive isolation in this island species-pair example is considerably stronger than most other stickleback examples, so this could potentially be a very useful system to work further on these questions.\nAlso evidence against “linear, bifurcating process” model.\n\nSpecies pairs? Or just ecotypes? Confusing."

In host plant divergence, does sympatry yield higher RI than allopatry (due to selection for reduced migration and reduced hybridisation)?\nMeasured “degree of sexual isolation in the absence of host plant”\nNatural temporal difference in the wasp species, so they stored some galls at 4 dec C for one week which delayed the emergence. Adults were used in experiments 1-2 days after emergence.\nMeasured host plant selection using a controlled two-choice experiment, using females instead of males (female host choice determines environment for next generation, and males display lower host fidelity).\n\nFemale aspirated into the container and observed for 30 min at 2-min intervals (15 obs), with the assumption that time spent on host plant is correlated with oviposition decision.\nCalculated proportion of time spent on natal plant (\\([0, 1]\\)), compared using GLMM.\nAlso calculated pairwise estimates of host plant preference difference: absolute difference between preference values calculated above (also \\([0, 1]\\)).\n\nMeasured sexual isolation by observing courtship and mating interactions between males and females, using controlled no-choice preference trials.\n\nMale and female (same or different species) aspirated into container, observed for same time, and recorded three interactions: male wing buzzing/fanning, male mounting female, copulation.\nCalculated probability of mating between conspecific and heterospecific pairs, and compared using GLMM.\nComparison between species pair type and individual pair cannot be done using GLMM, so they also calculated strength of sexual isolation between species pairs using a formula.\n\nEvidence that host use (ecological) interacts with geography in driving divergent selection in Belonocnema wasps.\n\nSympatric wasp species with different host plant showed highest habitat isolation, while allopatric with same host plant showed lowest.\nProximity to two host plant options increased host preference (Petri dish vs cups)\nSympatric also showed highest sexual isolation, while allopatric with same host plant showed lowest.\n\nHigh isolation in allopatric species with same host plant suggest that selection is not directly driven by habitat use. Similar selection environment could have taken different phenotypic pathways (mutation-order speciation).\nThree possible mechanisms for high isolation in sympatric species:\n\nTempleton effect/differential fusion: in sympatry, strong isolation is required for isolated populations to persist, whereas weakly isolated populations fuse.\nReinforcement: natural selection against hybrids with lower fitness\nReproductive interference: presence of sympatric species during mating (or cost of migration) could elevate prezygotic isolation\n\nAlso found asymmetry between habitat isolation and sexual isolation between allopatric species sharing the same host plant: lineage that emigrates more shows stronger habitat isolation (lower fitness of immigrants in alternative habitat) while lineage that receives more immigrants shows stronger sexual isolation (lower fitness of hybrids).\nThe three closely related wasp species are a good model for speciation research, due to their unique ecology and geography. Their framework is also useful for exploring completion of speciation, a knowledge gap."

    "text": "5.2 Schield et al 2024\n\nHow does the genetic basis of sexual selection result in barrier to gene flow in secondary contact?\nMost studies explore links between either sexual traits and reproductive isolation, or genomic divergence and genetic association with sexual traits. Not the full flow from genomic divergence to reproductive isolation via barrier to gene flow.\nFor species like Barn Swallow which are early in speciation process, sexual selection may be driving RI at small number of barrier loci involved in sexual traits.\n\nGenetic coupling of barrier loci (linkage disequilibrium) facilitates speciation, via both direct and indirect selection. With increase in coupled barrier loci, barrier to gene flow is stengthened.\nCoupling is likely to arise in allopatry, and can promote RI upon further secondary contact.\n\nBarn Swallow populations all diverged recently from the common ancestor about 11 kya, and there is strong evidence for divergent sexual selection among these populations.\n\nNot only does the species have multiple populations (subspecies), but there are also multiple hybrid zones, with varying divergence in sexual traits. These hybrid zones allow tests of whether sexual selection results in RI upon secondary contact.\nFurther, two of these hybrid zones also have divergences in nonbreeding migratory route, which is a potential coupled trait (low survival of hybrids taking nonadaptive migratory routes; i.e., hybrid fitness).\nExplicit tests of effects of trait loci on gene flow are necessary because degree of concordance between allopatric evolutionary processes and hybrid fitness is not clear a priori.\n\nDo sexual trait loci experience divergent sexual selection in allopatry and promote RI upon secondary contact? Is there LD among barrier loci (sexual traits, migratory route) in secondary contact, mainting RI via effects on hybrid fitness?\nFound that 6 ssp. cluster in 3 groups. Individuals from hybrid zones show intermediate/similar to parent plumage trait values (breast feather colour, tail streamer length) and admixture proportions.\nPrevalence of back-crossed, late generation hybrids, and demographic models, suggest that hybrid zones formed upon secondary contact following allopatry.\nrustica-gutturalis hybrid zone estimated to have formed 2000 generations ago, while the tytleri ones were more recent (&lt; 1000 generations).\nTrait variation is controlled by few loci and not several genes: both traits have high proportion of phenotypic variation explained (PVE) by SNP genotypes, and high proportion of genetic effects (PGE) by small number of SNPs.\nVentral colour SNPs on chromosome 1A and Z (genes affecting melanogenesis and feathering phenotype), whereas tail streamer length SNPs on chromosome 2 (enzymes with regulatory functions potentially affecting transcription, intracellular transport, growth factor stability).\n\nConcentration of ventral colour associations on Z chromosome (sex chromosome) supports that sex linkage is favourable for traits involved in mate choice and sexual isolation.\n\nAcross allopatric populations, sexual trait loci show more genetic differentiation (FST) than do genome-wide comparisons.\n\nThis could just be due to “background selection” in regions with reduced recombination. However, regions with extremely low recombination rates like centromeres also show higher FST in trait loci—high differentiation in trait loci is due to divergent positive selection rather than background selection alone. Elevated allelic differentitation and extended haplotype homozygosity, also suggest this.\nGreater fitness effects of ventral colour than tail streamer length.\n\nGeographic and genomic cline analysis, comparing trait loci–background loci differences across space along the three hybrid zone transects. -Found steeper transition between parental ancestries in trait loci cf background loci.\n\nSteepness itself could arise due to low population density in hybrid zones, but this would show similar clines in trait loci as in other highly differentiated loci (not the case)\nStronger selection and barrier to gene flow between rustica and other ssp.\nCline patterns are weakest in tytleri-gutturalis hybrid zone, possibly linked to absence of migratory divide between the two populations (though remains to be tested).\n\nLD arises from hybridisation, but extent of erosion of LD by recombination over generations can be impacted by selection-driven genetic coupling.\n\nThey compared interchromosomal LD between trait loci and background loci; if the LD was formed by admixture but not maintained by selection, would find similar levels between the two. But they found much higher LD levels in trait loci.\nIncrease in LD shows consistent differences between hybrid zones, with rustic hybrids showing higher.\nAlso no differences in LD between parental populations, therefore admixture important followed by selection.\nStarting levels of admixture LD higher than current levels, suggesting that selection worked by slowing erosion of LD, rather enhancing LD beyond starting levels.\n\nPrimary/major role of divergent sexual selection in genomic divergence and RI.\n\nPrevalence of back-crossed, late generation hybrids, and demographic models, suggest that hybrid zones formed upon secondary contact following allopatry. Assuming secondary contact? What if never isolated in the first place?\nNice detailed figures. Good communication/presentation.\nGenetic links of sexual trait loci –&gt; sexual trait loci divergence in fitness and selection –&gt; sexual trait loci are barriers to gene flow in sympatry —&gt; genetic coupling of barriers promotes RI"

    "text": "4.2 Intrinsic postzygotic isolation\nInternal to the individual/organism, so quite simply, developmental defects lead to hybrid sterility or inviability.\nIt can be meiosis issues related to ploidy levels, where hybrids like F1s simply cannot perform meiosis. Or chromosomal rearrangements/inversions like in Australian morabine grasshoppers (White 1978). However, many inversions surprisingly have no effect on heterozygote fitness, because recombination can still happen in other regions of genome.\nOther mechanisms include endosymbiotic infection risk for hybrids, or cytoplasmic incompatibilities especially relating to parasites (e.g., intracellular parasites like Wolbachia: when uninfected female flies are crossed with infected males, many/all progeny die, but infection transmitted from mother so those that are born from infected females are infected). There can even be mitonuclear incompatibilities (i.e., between mitochrondrial and cytoplasmic genetic material), famously in copepods (Ron Burton), so much so that Geoffrey Hill even introduced a mitonuclear compatibility species concept.\nAllelic incompatibilities are a major way intrinsic postzygotic isolation can occur. The original definition of Dobzhansky-Muller Incompatibility focused on alleles at different loci, arguing that low hybrid fitness is a byproduct of genomes that are geographically isolated. The newer, more specific definition emphasises epistasis (effects of an allele at one locus depend on alleles present at other loci), arguing that negative epistatic interactions occur between alleles of different loci with different evolutionary histories. Some assumptions of this theory are that there occurs at least one pair of allele changes, that most incompatibilities are due to derived alleles(?), and that the no. if incompatible combinations snowballs over time.\n\n4.2.1 Haldane’s Rule\nRule about sex chromosome incompatibilities; it is an exception, because there are very rare exceptions to the rule. Basically: in offspring of two different races, if one (and only one) sex is messed up (absent, rare, or sterile) then that is the heterozygous sex.\nNOT caused by: incompatibilities between X- and Y-linked genes; dosage compensation (compensate based on importance of stuff on X); chromosomal arrangement.\nPossible causes:\n\nDominance: in XY species, hybrid males are affected by all X-linked genes involved in genic incompatibilities, whereas hybrid females are affected only by dominant X-linked genes\nFaster-males: in XY species, incompatibilities affecting XY hybrids accumulate more quickly (but exceptions to this, so doesn’t satisfactorily explain)\nFaster-X: faster drift at population levels because more X than Y in population (thus this mechanism interacts with dominance)\nMeiotic drive: distorter alleles that distort Mendelian ratios to their own advantage; suppressors evolve to stop them. When two allopatric populations each independently evolve a driver and suppressor, suppressed drivers can become unmasked."

    "text": "2.2 Sympatric speciation\n\n2.2.1 Problems\nGenetic problem: Felsenstein (1981)—also inventor of bootstrapping, maximum likelihood estimation, etc.; has 15 papers with &gt;1000 citations—argued for the problem of recombination. In sympatry, need to avoid recombination by mating differentially.\nEcological problem: Ecological patterns like coexistence, competitive exclusion (Gause’s Rule) occur because in sympatry need to live differently enough from others.\n\n\n2.2.2 Solutions\nDisruptive sexual selection; disruptive natural selection (mating is linked to habitat, and the fewer genes [of large effect] the better). These are now very much linked to the concept of magic traits, for which there has been much evidence.\n\n\n2.2.3 Outstanding problem\nAdditional requirements for sympatric speciation are that they need to be sister species, and we need to be sure that past allopatry was unlikely. This has been more difficult to show, and many popular examples fail here.\nLake Victoria cichlids had crazy sympatric speciation possible due to a combination of factors like trophic divergence, sexual selection, and microallopatry. However, there is controversy around the idea that they are only 14,000 years old—some people don’t think the lake fully dried out.\nIn the case of Rhagoletis fruit flies, which have sympatric differentiation in host plant choice (between hawthorn and apple; GL Bush), it turned out that they were actually allopatric at some point and only the completion of the speciation process happened in sympatry (Feder et al 2003).\nSimilarly, in the case of stickleback ecomorphs in postglacial lakes, secondary contact drove character displacement and resulted in sister species, even though completion was in sympatry (Rundle & Schulter 2004).\nThus, more and more evidence has piled up to transform the dichotomy from sympatric vs allopatric speciation, to primary sympatric divergence vs secondary contact introgression."

    "text": "5.2 Comparative studies of reinforcement\nCan ask the following questions:\n\nIs prezyogtic isolation greater in sympatry?\n(Difficult to test) Are they forming hybrids?\n(Difficult to test) What is the genetic basis? (e.g., does having many great effect genes at few nearby loci facilitate more reinforcement (magic traits)?\n\nLots of work in this area, including on Drosophila from Dobzhansky & Koller 1938 (western US) to Matute 2010 (Sao Tome & Principe), and bindin protein in sea urchins. In the case of the Ficedula flycatchers, male plumage is driven by female choice (because females in sympatry are not different, only males are), and this is just females being choosier than males (fewer eggs than sperm). However, it is not fully clear whether the brown in Pied males evolved to enhance isolation from sympatric Collared, or whether it’s just female-mimicry in order to reduce intermale aggression. This is the more going on in this case.\nThe genetic basis of reinforcement has been reviewed in Garner et al 2018, and consists of genetic divergence both within species (allopatric vs sympatric contrasts) and between species (greater in sympatry, lower in allopatry). One example is flower colour in Phlox wildflowers, where colour is driven by two loci (intensity and hue), but selection happens on the intensity one."

    "text": "5.5 Bottom line\nThis is a theoretically possible mechanism, but in most cases it’s asking for a lot. There is a lot of evidence for greater divergence in sympatry, but most of these cases also have alternative explanations.\nThe best bet for such a mechanism would involve female choice resulting in heavier divergence in sympatry. This means that systems with greater sexual selection may be more likely to have reinforcement."
