  {"id":"bemmels2021","abstract":"Geographic contact between sister lineages often occurs near the final stages of speciation, but its role in speciation's completion remains debated. Reproductive isolation may be essentially complete prior to secondary contact. Alternatively, costly interactions between partially reproductively isolated species – such as maladaptive hybridization or competition for resources – may select for divergence, increasing reproductive isolation and driving speciation toward completion. Here, we use coalescent demographic modelling and whole-genome data sets to show that a period of contact and elevated hybridization between sympatric eastern North American populations of two cryptic bird species preceded a major increase in reproductive isolation between these populations within the last 10,000 years. In contrast, substantial introgression continues to the present in a western contact zone where geographic overlap is much narrower and probably of more recent origin. In the sympatric eastern region where reproductive isolation has increased, it is not accompanied by character displacement in key morphometric traits, plumage coloration, or ecological traits. While the precise trait and underlying mechanism driving increased reproductive isolation remains unknown, we discuss several possibilities and outline avenues for future research. Overall, our results highlight how demographic models can reveal the geographic context in which reproductive isolation was completed, and demonstrate how contact can accelerate the final stages of speciation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bemmels","given":"Jordan B."},{"family":"Bramwell","given":"Ashley C."},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Sean A.

  {"id":"coathup2024","abstract":"Theoretical models predict that sympatric, ecological speciation may be facilitated more readily when so-called ‘magic traits’ are present, linking traits under divergent selection with assortative mating. Such traits might be encoded by pleiotropic genes, that is, genes that affect multiple, apparently unrelated, phenotypes. However, few convincing examples of sympatric speciation exist, and empirical evidence for the role of magic traits in driving such speciation is rare. One of the strongest cases of sympatric speciation is the Howea palms of Lord Howe Island, Australia, comprising the sister species Howea belmoreana and Howea forsteriana, which have diverged due to soil substrate preferences and flowering time displacement. Here we investigate the role that pleiotropy may have played in the speciation process by carrying out high-throughput phenotyping experiments using 1830 Arabidopsis thaliana plants with knockouts of candidate Howea ‘speciation genes’. We identify several genes that show signatures of adaptive divergence between the Howea species and demonstrate pleiotropic roles in soil stress tolerance and flowering time, consistent with the Howea speciation scenario—notably, Howea orthologues of the A. thaliana loci At2-MMP, DCL1, RCD1, SAL1, and SIZ1. Empirical evidence is provided, therefore, for a range of pleiotropic genes with the potential to have driven sympatric speciation by generating magic traits which link divergent selection to non-random mating.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Coathup","given":"Matthew J"},{"family":"Mouhu","given":"Katriina"},{"family":"Himanen","given":"Kristiina"},{"family":"Turnbull","given":"Colin G N"},{"family":"Savolainen","given":"Vincent"}],"citation-key":"coathup2024","container-title":"Evolutionary Journal of the Linnean Society","container-title-short":"Evol J Linn Soc","DOI":"10.1093/evolinnean/kzae017","ISSN":"2752-938X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,1]]},"page":"kzae017","source":"Silverchair","title":"Ecological speciation in sympatric palms: 5.

  {"id":"dean2019","abstract":"Ecological speciation has become a popular model for the development and maintenance of reproductive isolation in closely related sympatric pairs of species or ecotypes. An implicit assumption has been that such pairs originate (possibly with gene flow) from a recent, genetically homogeneous ancestor. However, recent genomic data have revealed that currently sympatric taxa are often a result of secondary contact between ancestrally allopatric lineages. This has sparked an interest in the importance of initial hybridization upon secondary contact, with genomic reanalysis of classic examples of ecological speciation often implicating admixture in speciation. We describe a novel occurrence of unusually well-developed reproductive isolation in a model system for ecological speciation: the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), breeding sympatrically in multiple lagoons on the Scottish island of North Uist. Using morphological data, targeted genotyping, and genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data, we show that lagoon resident and anadromous ecotypes are strongly reproductively isolated with an estimated hybridization rate of only ∼1%. We use palaeoecological and genetic data to test three hypotheses to explain the existence of these species-pairs. Our results suggest that recent, purely ecological speciation from a genetically homogeneous ancestor is probably not solely responsible for the evolution of species-pairs. Instead, we reveal a complex colonization history with multiple ancestral lineages contributing to the genetic composition of species-pairs, alongside strong disruptive selection. Our results imply a role for admixture upon secondary contact and are consistent with the recent suggestion that the genomic underpinning of ecological speciation often has an older, allopatric origin.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Dean","given":"Laura L"},{"family":"Magalhaes","given":"Isabel S"},{"family":"Foote","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"D’Agostino","given":"Daniele"},{"family":"McGowan","given":"Suzanne"},{"family":"MacColl","given":"Andrew D C"}],"citation-key":"dean2019","container-title":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Mol Biol Evol","DOI":"10.1093/molbev/msz161","ISSN":"0737-4038","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,1]]},"page":"2481-2497","source":"Silverchair","title":"Admixture between Ancient Lineages, Selection, and the Formation of Sympatric Stickleback Species-Pairs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msz161","volume":"36"},

We investigate how within-species variation in sperm and egg recognition proteins, potentially generated via sexual conflict, influences reproductive isolation between two partially sympatric sea urchin species; the North American west coast Mesocentrotus franciscanus and the circumpolar Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis. Barriers to hybridization are stronger when eggs are given a choice of conspecific versus heterospecific sperm and the variation in hybridization among crosses can be explained by whether the sperm or egg protein variant is ancestral or derived. Derived proteins can be recognized as different and prevent hybridization. Examination of the allele frequencies of these proteins in M. franciscanus in and out of sympatry with S. droebachiensis along the west coast of North America reveals evidence of reinforcement selection and reproductive character displacement in eggs but not sperm, which likely reflects the differential cost of hybridization for males and females.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Levitan","given":"Don R"},{"family":"Hao","given":"Yueling"}],"citation-key":"levitan2025","container-title":"Evolution","container-title-short":"Evol","DOI":"10.1093/evolut/qpaf092","ISSN":"0014-3820","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",8,1]]},"page":"1522-1532","source":"Silverchair","title":"Hybridization, reinforcement selection, and sex-dependent reproductive character displacement of sperm and egg recognition proteins","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/evolut/qpaf092","volume":"79"},
  {"id":"maddison1997","abstract":"Exploration of the relationship between gene trees and their containing species trees leads to consideration of how to reconstruct species trees from gene trees and of the concept of phylogeny as a cloud of gene histories. When gene copies are sampled from various species, the gene tree relating these copies might disagree with the species phylogeny. This discord can arise from horizontal transfer (including hybridization), lineage sorting, and gene duplication and extinction. Lineage sorting could also be called deep coalescence, the failure of ancestral copies to coalesce (looking backwards in time) into a common ancestral copy until deeper than previous speciation events. These events depend on various factors; for instance, deep coalescence is more likely if the branches of the species tree are short (in generations) and wide (in population size). A similar dependence on process is found in historical biogeography and host-parasite relationships. Each of the processes of discord could yield a different parsimony criterion for reconstructing the species tree from a set of gene trees: with horizontal transfer, choose the species tree that minimizes the number of transfer events; with deep coalescence, choose the tree minimizing the number of extra gene lineages that had to coexist along species lineages; with gene duplication, choose the tree minimizing duplication and/or extinction events. Maximum likelihood methods for reconstructing the species tree are also possible because coalescence theory provides the probability that a particular gene tree would occur given a species tree (with branch lengths and widths specified). In considering these issues, one is provoked to reconsider precisely what is phylogeny. Perhaps it is misleading to view some gene trees as agreeing and other gene trees as disagreeing with the species tree; rather, all of the gene trees are part of the species tree, which can be visualized like a fuzzy statistical distribution, a cloud of gene histories. Alternatively, phylogeny might be (and has been) viewed not as a history of what happened, genetically, but as a history of what could have happened, i.e., a history of changes in the probabilities of inter-breeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Maddison","given":"Wayne P."}],"citation-key":"maddison1997","container-title":"Systematic Biology","container-title-short":"Syst Biol","DOI":"10.1093/sysbio/46.3.523","ISSN":"1063-5157","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",9,1]]},"page":"523-536","source":"Silverchair","title":"Gene Trees in Species Trees","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/46.3.523","volume":"46"},

Mitochondrial genes evolve rapidly and exist in dense gene networks with coevolved nuclear genes, suggesting that mitochondrial respiration may be particularly susceptible to disruption in hybrid organisms. Mitonuclear interactions have been demonstrated to contribute to hybrid dysfunction between deeply divergent taxa crossed in the laboratory, but there are few empirical examples of mitonuclear interactions between younger lineages that naturally hybridize. Here, we use controlled hybrid crosses and high-resolution respirometry to provide the first experimental evidence in a bird that inter-lineage mitonuclear interactions impact mitochondrial aerobic metabolism. Specifically, respiration capacity of the two mitodiscordant backcrosses (with mismatched mitonuclear combinations) differs from one another, although they do not differ significantly from the parental groups or mitoconcordant backcrosses as we would expect of mitonuclear disruptions. In the wild hybrid zone between these subspecies, the mitochondrial cline centre is shifted west of the nuclear cline centre, which is consistent with the direction of our experimental results. Our results therefore demonstrate asymmetric mitonuclear interactions that impact the capacity of cellular mitochondrial respiration and may help to explain the geographic discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes observed in the wild.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,18]]},"author":[{"family":"McDiarmid","given":"Callum S."},{"family":"Hooper","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Stier","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Griffith","given":"Simon C."}],"citation-key":"mcdiarmid2024","container-title":"Molecular Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/mec.17374","ISSN":"1365-294X","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2024 The Authors.

Here we describe a mitonuclear incompatibility involving three genes whose protein products are in physical contact within respiratory complex I of naturally hybridizing swordtail fish species. Individuals homozygous for mismatched protein combinations do not complete embryonic development or die as juveniles, whereas those heterozygous for the incompatibility have reduced complex I function and unbalanced representation of parental alleles in the mitochondrial proteome. We find that the effects of different genetic interactions on survival are non-additive, highlighting subtle complexity in the genetic architecture of hybrid incompatibilities.

A way forward is to compare pairs of ecotypes that evolved in parallel in similar contexts but have reached different degrees of reproductive isolation. Such comparisons are possible in the marine snail Littorina saxatilis by contrasting barriers to gene flow between parallel ecotypes in Spain and Sweden. In both countries, divergent ecotypes have evolved to withstand either crab predation or wave action. Here, we explore transects spanning contact zones between the Crab and the Wave ecotypes using low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, morphological and behavioural traits. Despite parallel phenotypic divergence, distinct patterns of differentiation between the ecotypes emerged: a continuous cline in Sweden indicating a weak barrier to gene flow, but two highly genetically and phenotypically divergent, and partly spatially overlapping clusters in Spain suggesting a much stronger barrier to gene flow. The absence of Spanish early-generation hybrids supported strong isolation, but a low level of gene flow is evident from molecular data. In both countries, highly differentiated loci were located in both shared and country-specific chromosomal inversions but were also present in collinear regions. Despite being considered the same species and showing similar levels of phenotypic divergence, the Spanish ecotypes are much closer to full reproductive isolation than the Swedish ones.
