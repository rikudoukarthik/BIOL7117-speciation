  {"id":"coathup2024","abstract":"Theoretical models predict that sympatric, ecological speciation may be facilitated more readily when so-called ‘magic traits’ are present, linking traits under divergent selection with assortative mating. Such traits might be encoded by pleiotropic genes, that is, genes that affect multiple, apparently unrelated, phenotypes. However, few convincing examples of sympatric speciation exist, and empirical evidence for the role of magic traits in driving such speciation is rare. One of the strongest cases of sympatric speciation is the Howea palms of Lord Howe Island, Australia, comprising the sister species Howea belmoreana and Howea forsteriana, which have diverged due to soil substrate preferences and flowering time displacement. Here we investigate the role that pleiotropy may have played in the speciation process by carrying out high-throughput phenotyping experiments using 1830 Arabidopsis thaliana plants with knockouts of candidate Howea ‘speciation genes’. We identify several genes that show signatures of adaptive divergence between the Howea species and demonstrate pleiotropic roles in soil stress tolerance and flowering time, consistent with the Howea speciation scenario—notably, Howea orthologues of the A. thaliana loci At2-MMP, DCL1, RCD1, SAL1, and SIZ1. Empirical evidence is provided, therefore, for a range of pleiotropic genes with the potential to have driven sympatric speciation by generating magic traits which link divergent selection to non-random mating.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Coathup","given":"Matthew J"},{"family":"Mouhu","given":"Katriina"},{"family":"Himanen","given":"Kristiina"},{"family":"Turnbull","given":"Colin G N"},{"family":"Savolainen","given":"Vincent"}],"citation-key":"coathup2024","container-title":"Evolutionary Journal of the Linnean Society","container-title-short":"Evol J Linn Soc","DOI":"10.1093/evolinnean/kzae017","ISSN":"2752-938X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,1]]},"page":"kzae017","source":"Silverchair","title":"Ecological speciation in sympatric palms: 5.

  {"id":"dean2019","abstract":"Ecological speciation has become a popular model for the development and maintenance of reproductive isolation in closely related sympatric pairs of species or ecotypes. An implicit assumption has been that such pairs originate (possibly with gene flow) from a recent, genetically homogeneous ancestor. However, recent genomic data have revealed that currently sympatric taxa are often a result of secondary contact between ancestrally allopatric lineages. This has sparked an interest in the importance of initial hybridization upon secondary contact, with genomic reanalysis of classic examples of ecological speciation often implicating admixture in speciation. We describe a novel occurrence of unusually well-developed reproductive isolation in a model system for ecological speciation: the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), breeding sympatrically in multiple lagoons on the Scottish island of North Uist. Using morphological data, targeted genotyping, and genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data, we show that lagoon resident and anadromous ecotypes are strongly reproductively isolated with an estimated hybridization rate of only ∼1%. We use palaeoecological and genetic data to test three hypotheses to explain the existence of these species-pairs. Our results suggest that recent, purely ecological speciation from a genetically homogeneous ancestor is probably not solely responsible for the evolution of species-pairs. Instead, we reveal a complex colonization history with multiple ancestral lineages contributing to the genetic composition of species-pairs, alongside strong disruptive selection. Our results imply a role for admixture upon secondary contact and are consistent with the recent suggestion that the genomic underpinning of ecological speciation often has an older, allopatric origin.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Dean","given":"Laura L"},{"family":"Magalhaes","given":"Isabel S"},{"family":"Foote","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"D’Agostino","given":"Daniele"},{"family":"McGowan","given":"Suzanne"},{"family":"MacColl","given":"Andrew D C"}],"citation-key":"dean2019","container-title":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Mol Biol Evol","DOI":"10.1093/molbev/msz161","ISSN":"0737-4038","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,1]]},"page":"2481-2497","source":"Silverchair","title":"Admixture between Ancient Lineages, Selection, and the Formation of Sympatric Stickleback Species-Pairs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msz161","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"maddison1997","abstract":"Exploration of the relationship between gene trees and their containing species trees leads to consideration of how to reconstruct species trees from gene trees and of the concept of phylogeny as a cloud of gene histories. When gene copies are sampled from various species, the gene tree relating these copies might disagree with the species phylogeny. This discord can arise from horizontal transfer (including hybridization), lineage sorting, and gene duplication and extinction. Lineage sorting could also be called deep coalescence, the failure of ancestral copies to coalesce (looking backwards in time) into a common ancestral copy until deeper than previous speciation events. These events depend on various factors; for instance, deep coalescence is more likely if the branches of the species tree are short (in generations) and wide (in population size). A similar dependence on process is found in historical biogeography and host-parasite relationships. Each of the processes of discord could yield a different parsimony criterion for reconstructing the species tree from a set of gene trees: with horizontal transfer, choose the species tree that minimizes the number of transfer events; with deep coalescence, choose the tree minimizing the number of extra gene lineages that had to coexist along species lineages; with gene duplication, choose the tree minimizing duplication and/or extinction events. Maximum likelihood methods for reconstructing the species tree are also possible because coalescence theory provides the probability that a particular gene tree would occur given a species tree (with branch lengths and widths specified). In considering these issues, one is provoked to reconsider precisely what is phylogeny. Perhaps it is misleading to view some gene trees as agreeing and other gene trees as disagreeing with the species tree; rather, all of the gene trees are part of the species tree, which can be visualized like a fuzzy statistical distribution, a cloud of gene histories. Alternatively, phylogeny might be (and has been) viewed not as a history of what happened, genetically, but as a history of what could have happened, i.e., a history of changes in the probabilities of inter-breeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Maddison","given":"Wayne P."}],"citation-key":"maddison1997","container-title":"Systematic Biology","container-title-short":"Syst Biol","DOI":"10.1093/sysbio/46.3.523","ISSN":"1063-5157","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",9,1]]},"page":"523-536","source":"Silverchair","title":"Gene Trees in Species Trees","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/46.3.523","volume":"46"},

  {"id":"mcgill2019","abstract":"Macroecology is a growing and important subdiscipline of ecology, but it is becoming increasingly diffuse, without an organizing principle that is widely agreed upon. I highlight two main current views of macroecology: as the study of large-scale systems and as the study of emergent systems. I trace the history of both these views through the writings of the founders of macroecology. I also highlight the transmutation principle that identifies serious limitations to the study of large-scale systems with reductionist approaches. And I suggest that much of the underlying goal of macroecology is the pursuit of general principles and the escape from contingency. I highlight that there are many intertwined aspects of macroecology, with a number of resulting implications. I propose that returning to a focus on studying assemblages of a large number of particles is a helpful view. I propose defining macroecology as “the study at the aggregate level of aggregate ecological entities made up of large numbers of particles for the purposes of pursuing generality”.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"McGill","given":"Brian J."}],"citation-key":"mcgill2019","container-title":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/geb.12855","ISSN":"1466-8238","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","page":"6-17","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The what, how and why of doing macroecology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12855","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"rundle2005","abstract":"Ecological processes are central to the formation of new species when barriers to gene flow (reproductive isolation) evolve between populations as a result of ecologically-based divergent selection. Although laboratory and field studies provide evidence that ‘ecological speciation’ can occur, our understanding of the details of the process is incomplete. Here we review ecological speciation by considering its constituent components: an ecological source of divergent selection, a form of reproductive isolation, and a genetic mechanism linking the two. Sources of divergent selection include differences in environment or niche, certain forms of sexual selection, and the ecological interaction of populations. We explore the evidence for the contribution of each to ecological speciation. Forms of reproductive isolation are diverse and we discuss the likelihood that each may be involved in ecological speciation. Divergent selection on genes affecting ecological traits can be transmitted directly (via pleiotropy) or indirectly (via linkage disequilibrium) to genes causing reproductive isolation and we explore the consequences of both. Along with these components, we also discuss the geography and the genetic basis of ecological speciation. Throughout, we provide examples from nature, critically evaluate their quality, and highlight areas where more work is required.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Rundle","given":"Howard D."},{"family":"Nosil","given":"Patrik"}],"citation-key":"rundle2005","container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00715.x","ISSN":"1461-0248","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en","page":"336-352","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Ecological speciation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00715.x","volume":"8"},

We unravel the genetic basis of sexually selected plumage traits to investigate their effects on reproductive isolation in barn swallows. The genetic architecture of sexual traits is characterized by 12 loci on two autosomes and the Z chromosome. Sexual trait loci exhibit signatures of divergent selection in geographic isolation and barriers to gene flow in secondary contact. Linkage disequilibrium between these genes has been maintained by selection in hybrid zones beyond what would be expected under admixture alone. Our findings reveal that selection on coupled sexual trait loci promotes reproductive isolation, providing key empirical evidence for the role of sexual selection in speciation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Schield","given":"Drew R."},{"family":"Carter","given":"Javan K."},{"family":"Scordato","given":"Elizabeth S.

  {"id":"zhang2024","abstract":"Ecology and geography can play important roles in the evolution of reproductive isolation across the speciation continuum, but few studies address both at the later stages of speciation. This notable gap in knowledge arises from the fact that traditional ecological speciation studies have predominantly focused on the role of ecology in initiating the speciation process, while many studies exploring the effect of geography (e.g., reinforcement) concentrate on species pairs that lack divergent ecological characteristics. We simultaneously examine the strength of habitat isolation and sexual isolation among three closely related species of Belonocnema gall-forming wasps on two species of live oaks, Quercus virginiana and Q. geminata, that experience divergent selection from their host plants and variable rates of migration due to their geographic context. We find that the strength of both habitat isolation and sexual isolation is lowest among allopatric species pairs with the same host plant association, followed by allopatric species with different host plant associations, and highest between sympatric species with different host-plant associations. This pattern suggests that divergent selection due to different host use interacts with geography in the evolution of habitat isolation and sexual isolation during the later stages of speciation of Belonocnema wasps.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Linyi"},{"family":"Hood","given":"Glen Ray"},{"family":"Ott","given":"James R"},{"family":"Egan","given":"Scott P"}],"citation-key":"zhang2024","container-title":"Journal of Evolutionary Biology","container-title-short":"j. evol.
